# Rock_Paper_Scissors
This is a simple code for a Rock Paper Scissors game that I implemented before starting Makers Academy.
A more experienced version was implemented during the course and you can compare my improvements here: <a href="https://github.com/Debora38/rps-challenge">rps-challenge, week 3</a>

The first draft was created 1 month before committing it, which falls also before the start of my pre-course with the bootcamp.
All the other commits after, were created at the end of my pre-course, still before the start of my actual on-site bootcamp.

The final version has encapsulated blocks and presents more features, such as:
<li>keeping the score
<li>asking the user to set a winning score for the match
<li>personalises the score with the name of the user (asked via input)
